# Welcome

This is documentation section about IOTA documentation: what we write and how we write.

IOTA Foundation employs a team of technical writers. We mostly contribute to the [Build](/build/welcome) section and trust you, the community, with maintaining IOTA Wiki as a whole. You can always reach to us if you need advice, a review, or any other help. We have listed our contacts [below](#contact-technical-writers).

If you wish to contribute to the wiki, check our [guide](for_community/community_guide.md) for community.

As a software developer from an [X-team](../the-community/x-teams.md) or IOTA Foundation, you will find tips on how to document your project together with IOTA's technical writers in the [developers' section](for_devs/developer_guide.md). As a technical writer, you will find our current conventions in our [writer's guide](for_tws/writer_guide.md).

## Contact Technical Writers

If you want to DM a technical writer on Discord, make sure that you have joined our [server](../the-community/discord.md) first.
