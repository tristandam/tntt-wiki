# Toolbox

Technical writers ask for quite a lot from you. Not only do you have to provide us with information, but you also have to structure it well and make sure that it is precise and extensive. We offer you a toolbox to get you going, a collection of tools that help you to put your expertise into words.

You could give all tools a try. Or you could try only the tools you liked. Or wait for an opportunity to test a tool later. Maybe you brought your own tools: help us expand this section then!

To quote Roy Peter Clark, an American journalist and teacher:

> Remember, these are tools, not rules. They work outside the territory of right and wrong, and inside the land of cause and effect.

> *An excerpt from Writing Tools*

You use a tool only when you need it, anticipating a certain result. Remember your goal and pick the right tool for the job.
