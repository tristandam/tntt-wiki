# TW Review and Approval (Internal)

This procedure outlines how the Technical Writing team reviews and approves content that we had a hand in creating, editing, etc. This includes articles, blog posts, code, internal/external PRs, and so on.

1. After the principal TW has completed their content, they submit a PR in GitHub and ask for the review of at least two other TWs. The reviewers must be notified within GitHub (via request review) and within slack (@teammember) with the PR link.

   - Three are able to review if requested or are interested and have the bandwidth.
   - In case of sick leave, vacations, etc., a PR could be reviewed and approved by only one editor.

   :::Note

   PRs are the norm for a review but other mediums, such as Google docs, may be included as well.

   :::

2. The reviewers first round of feedback should be returned within the 36-48 hour timeframe per the request.

   - If there is a review deadline, the principal TW must notify the reviewers of the timeframe in which they have to work

3. A single review iteration must be finished within the above timeframe, but the _cycle_ of a review will continue until both the initial TW and reviewers are satisfied with the state of the content.

4. To merge, the latest revision of PR needs at least two reviews, at least one of which has to be approving, and none of which are requesting changes.

5. Once all content is approved, the initial TW can merge and close the PR, notifying the reviewers and any other applicable parties.
