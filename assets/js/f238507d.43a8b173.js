The provided file is locally hashed and compared with the fetched fingerprint stored on the Tangle.\nUsers can also publish new data fingerprints of a file and receive a message-id that references the Proof of Existence in the Tangle.\nAdditionally, as the Tangle never exposes the document to the public, the users remain in complete control of the document. An application can use the hash stored on the Tangle to verify the document\'s integrity, but the underlying document can not be derived from it.
