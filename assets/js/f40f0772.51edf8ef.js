First, it was to help our research engineers figure out how to code certain modules, since parts of the prototype were written before the specs.

The implementation of the protocol is the software that performs the actual operations dictated by the protocol. The protocol is unique and fixed, while the implementation varies. For example, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) dictates how your browser should communicate with internet servers. There are several browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc.) which run this protocol. Internally, these browsers work very differently from each other, having different features and designs, but they all communicate with a server in the same way.

The IOTA Foundation will create two software implementations of this protocol: Bee and Hornet, written in rust and go respectively.

Using the protocol specifications, anybody can (and hopefully eventually will) write their own software implementations with their own implementation specifications.
